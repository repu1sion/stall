This is the README file of the project. Put here a brief introduction of the gameplay,
main goal (even if it is obvious), waves description, alien movements, etc.

Also, it is a good idea write it on Github Web interface and provide a screenshot
image or animated GIF screenshot which will be displayed as if it were a short video.

Last but no least, you can delete these lines and replace them with your text.
Congratulations for your job and best regards. Wish you well, Andrii!!!

Installation
------------

To install using the GNU Build System method, just open a terminal and
type the following commands:

	username@host: dir $ git clone https://github.com/repu1sion/stall.git stall
	username@host: dir $ cd stall
	username@host: stall $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
	username@host: stall $ make
	[ become superuser if needed ]
	username@host: stall $ make install-strip

In order to compile this game you will need SDL headers and libs, more specifically
libSDL, libSDL_gfx, libSDL_ttf and libSDL_image, so make sure you got those
requirements before run "make". Otherwise, compilation will fail.
